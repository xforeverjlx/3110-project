Easy level bot: 
  - random decisions
  
Medium level bot logic: 
  - If pre-flop then go by table else
  - Get mean of the average hand strengths under 0, 1, or 2 more cards dealt (in x number of simulations)
  - Do the same for the opponent, assuming a random hand
  - Make a decision based on the difference between my strength and the opponent's strength
